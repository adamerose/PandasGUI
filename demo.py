# PandasGUI comes with sample datasets which get downloaded on first import.
# This includes `all_datasets` which is a dictionary of all the sample datasets like Dict[str, DataFrame]
# You can pass DataFrames as kwargs to specify different names. This also works with dictionary unpacking

# The only reserved argument name is `settings`, which accepts a dictionary of settings for the GUI.

# PandasGUI will attempt to convert any object you pass to `show` into a DataFrame

# Read DataFrames from the GUI using square brackets
